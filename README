CONFIGURING

  There is a configuration file called settings.yml in the data folder, which
  allows the app to be configured for installation and performance purposes.
  Open that file to read the comments provided above each value.

----------------------------------------------------


COMPILING

  Get the source from
    https://github.com/jtnimoy/Bandwidth

  Install OpenFrameworks PreRelease v007

  Create an empty project and add the contents of the src folder to it.
  Add the contents of the 'data' folder to the project's data folder.

  Getting the project to compile is a matter of downloading and compiling the 2 dependencies:

    Box2D 2.2.0
      and
    yaml-cpp 1.2.7
